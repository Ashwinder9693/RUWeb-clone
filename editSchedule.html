				Statement</h1>
			<div id="financial2"
				style="line-height: 16px; padding-bottom: 25px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; display: none;">


				By registering for class(es), I acknowledge that I have read, understand, and agree to the following
				terms and conditions.
				I understand that I am agreeing to a legally binding contract to pay all tuition and fees assessed to my
				student account and all additional costs and expenses related to my enrollment at
				Rutgers University ("Rutgers"). These costs and expenses include, but are not limited to, housing, meal
				plans, flex dollars, health insurance and all other departmental or school costs
				processed through my student account.<div class="frs_spacing1"></div>


				<span class="frs_header1">
					Agreement to Pay and Due Dates:
				</span>
				I understand that when I register for classes at Rutgers University and receive services, I accept full
				responsibility to pay all tuition, fees and other associated costs assessed as a result
				of my registration and/or receipt of services. I further understand and agree that my enrollment and
				acceptance of these terms constitutes a promissory note agreement
				(i.e., a financial obligation in the form of an educational loan as defined by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
				at 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(8)) in which Rutgers University is providing me educational services,
				deferring some or all of my payment obligation for those services, and I promise to pay for all assessed
				tuition, fees and other associated costs by the published or assigned due date.)
				<div class="frs_spacing1"></div>
				I promise to pay all tuition, fees, costs, credit, goods, services and expenses by the published due
				date specified in the most recent Rutgers publication setting a due date or by a due date agreed to
				between myself and Rutgers in a separate written agreement specifically applicable to a cost, expense,
				fee or other sum due.
				If there is no due date as agreed as set forth above or provided in this agreement, then my obligation
				shall fall due ten (10) days after I have incurred the obligation.
				<div class="frs_spacing1"></div>


				<span class="frs_header1">
					Effect of Withdrawal/Dropping Classes on My Financial Responsibility:
				</span>
				I understand and agree that if I drop or withdraw from some or all of the classes for which I register,
				I will be responsible for paying all or a portion of my tuition and fees in accordance with
				Rutgers's published tuition refund schedule in effect at the time I withdraw from or drop courses.
				I have read the terms and conditions of Rutgers's published tuition refund schedule and understand those
				terms are incorporated herein by reference.
				I acknowledge and understand that my absence from or failure to attend class(es) or my non-receipt of a
				bill from Rutgers does not defer the due dates or relieve me of my financial responsibilities to
				Rutgers.
				I also acknowledge that specific programs, such as Study Abroad, may have separate and unique refund
				policies with respect to their individual program costs,
				and that I am likewise responsible for adhering to any specific financial responsibilities outlined in
				the respective terms and conditions of any such program I agree to participate in.
				<div class="frs_spacing1"></div>


				<span class="frs_header1">
					Federal Aid:
				</span>
				I understand that any federal or state financial aid (including Title IV and/or Title VII funds) that I
				receive, except for Federal Work Study wages, will first be applied to any outstanding
				balance on my account for tuition, fees, room and board. Title IV financial aid includes aid from the
				Pell Grant, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Direct Loans, PLUS Loans,
				and Perkins Loans programs. I authorize Rutgers University to apply my Title IV and/or Title VII
				financial aid to other charges assessed to my student account such as student health insurance,
				parking permits and fines, bookstore charges, service fees and fines, and any other educationally
				related charges. I further understand that this authorization will remain in effect
				until I formally rescind it by <a href="mailto:titleiv@sa.rutgers.edu">contacting Student
					Accounting</a>.
				<div class="frs_spacing1"></div>


				<span class="frs_header1">
					Method of Communication:
				</span>
				I understand and agree to Rutgers using e-mail as one of its official methods of communication.
				I am responsible for promptly reading the emails I receive from Rutgers or those acting on its behalf.
				<div class="frs_spacing1"></div>


				<span class="frs_header1">
					Method of Billing:
				</span>
				I understand that Rutgers uses electronic billing (e-bill) as its official billing method, and therefore
				I am responsible for viewing and paying my student account e-bill by the scheduled due date.
				I further understand that a failure to review my e- bill does not constitute a valid reason for not
				paying my bill on time.
				E-bill information is available to me on studentabc.rutgers.edu.
				<div class="frs_spacing1"></div>


				<span class="frs_header1">
					Consent to Methods of Contact:
				</span>
				I authorize Rutgers, its agents and contractors to contact me at my current and any future cellular
				phone number(s), email address(es) or wireless device(s) regarding a) student account billing
				and payments, b) my delinquent student account(s)/loan(s), and/or c) any other debt I owe to Rutgers
				and/or d) to receive general information from Rutgers.
				I authorize Rutgers and its agents and contractors to use automated telephone dialing equipment,
				artificial or pre-recorded voice or text messages, and personal calls and emails,
				in their efforts to contact you. Furthermore, I understand that I may withdraw my consent to calls to my
				cellular phone by submitting my request in writing to
				Rutgers's Student Financial Services' Office or in writing to the applicable agent or contractor
				contacting me on behalf of Rutgers.
				<div class="frs_spacing1"></div>


				<span class="frs_header1">
					Electronic Delivery of IRS Form 1098-T:
				</span>
				I understand that Rutgers University will deliver my IRS Form 1098-T electronically every year I have
				reportable transactions, and that I may view and print IRS Form 1098-T by logging into
				<a target="_blank"
					href="https://studentabc.rutgers.edu/tax-information">https://studentabc.rutgers.edu/tax-information</a>
				and following the appropriate instructions for Legacy or RBHS students, respectively.
				I further understand that by consenting to receive this information electronically, a paper copy of my
				Form 1098-T will not be mailed.
				<div class="frs_spacing1"></div>


				<span class="frs_header1">
					Delinquent Accounts/Collections:
				</span>
				I agree that if I fail to pay any sums payable to Rutgers by the scheduled due date, Rutgers may place a
				Hold on my account and may deny, withhold or refuse services and/or credit including
				future registration, loans, housing and other certifications until all sums due and payable to Rutgers
